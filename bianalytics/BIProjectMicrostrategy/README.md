For this assignment, created a presentation-ready dashboard to monitor the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for all three restaurant locations. To achieve this, we were given access to the latest Sales and Marketing data for those locations. Found reasons for the causes for why some restaurant locations are performing the worst.

Prepared the final report to be submitted, including final report - the details of our analysis of Micro Strategy BI capabilities (based on analyses above) and all findings for this project.
