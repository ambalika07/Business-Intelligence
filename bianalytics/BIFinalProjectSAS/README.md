SAS Project Assignment consists of two parts:

Part 1- Creating BI reports to use by other people beside the Marketing VP

Part 2 - Using Data Visualization for Problem Solving techniques in order to investigate specific business or social problems. In this specific case, our task is to creatively combine the available data with the available visualization tools to answer a particular question by applying the scientific method. We tried to strike a balance between the best charts/graphs that allow answering the specific question and those that have more power to communicate certain ideas.
